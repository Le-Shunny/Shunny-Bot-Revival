    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hello there! My name is cyprus jake paccoy and I am the owner of kurumi project. I love exploring new technologies and building exciting projects that can make a positive impact on people's lives.</p>

    <h1>About Kurumi Bot</h1>
    <div class="project-info">
        <p>Kurumi Bot is a project that I have been working on lately. It's an AI-powered chatbot designed to assist users with various tasks and answer their questions. The name "Kurumi" means "walnut" in Japanese, symbolizing the idea of a bot with a smart and compact core.</p>
        
        <p>Kurumi Bot is programmed with advanced natural language processing and machine learning techniques, allowing it to understand user input and provide relevant and helpful responses. It can handle a wide range of queries, from general knowledge questions to task automation.</p>
        
        <p>My inspiration for creating Kurumi Bot came from my fascination with AI and its potential to simplify our lives. I wanted to develop a bot that could not only showcase the power of AI but also be genuinely useful to people in their day-to-day activities.</p>
        
        <p>I am continuously working on improving Kurumi Bot, adding new features, and enhancing its capabilities. My goal is to make it a reliable and user-friendly virtual assistant that can be accessed easily across various platforms.</p>
        
        <p>If you have any questions or feedback about Kurumi Bot or any other project, feel free to reach out to me. I'm always eager to learn and collaborate with fellow enthusiasts!</p>
